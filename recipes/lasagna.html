            <li>¼ cup margarine</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

            <li>½ cup vegetable broth, or as needed</li>       
            <li>2 tablespoons white wine</li>        
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>        
            <li>1 cup light ricotta cheese</li>        
            <li>1 egg</li>        
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>        
            <li>2 cups coarsely shredded carrots</li>        
            <li>2 cups coarsely chopped zucchini</li>        
            <li>V1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach</li>       
           <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.</li>
            <li>Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.</li>
            <li>Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
